## Data Preparation
Read in both happiness data and world development indicators data separately. Subset on the indicators. Merge the two datasets on the country names. However, the following countries in the happiness data go by different names (sometimes offical) in the WDI data: There are only 18 of them, so it is easy enough to do a hard-code replacement. **Taiwan** is not in the WDI dataset.
