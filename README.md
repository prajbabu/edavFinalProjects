# Happiness vs. World Development Indicators
This repository holds the report which examines happiness values and a swath of development indicators for countries around the world. This report was also submitted as a final project in the Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class at Columbia University in Fall 2019.

## Usage
First, due to the size of the initial World Bank dataset, we will not house the original. Instead, follow these steps to reproduce the report:

1. Clone this repo into a folder.
2. Download the full World Bank Indicator set (~64 MB) [here](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_excel.zip).
3. Extract the sole Excel file inside to top level repo folder `/edavFinalProjects`.
4. Open RStudio, and knit the `FinalReport.Rmd` inside the `ReportOutput` folder to HTML. Make sure the working directory is set to the top level `edavFinalProjects` directory! The requisite transformed datasets will get generated, as the happiness data is pulled from online. That said, please ensure you have an internet connection if you are running for the first time. As long as the transformed file exists, the transformation scripts will not be run.
5. Enjoy!

### Interactivity
We also produced an interactive visualization house [here](https://bl.ocks.org/prajbabu/raw/64632ce0480ca5bdfdc03ebe55189d20/71d16abad6fb300447918e825cab23db20c43f21/) for your leisure.

## Mismatched countries
the following countries in the happiness data go by different names (sometimes offical) in the WDI data: There are only 18 of them, so it is easy enough to do a hard-code replacement. **Taiwan** and **Somaliland** (a region of autonomity in upper Somalia) are not in the WDI dataset.
